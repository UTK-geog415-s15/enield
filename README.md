My name is Emily Nield (my last name is pronounced like field or yield but with an N). I am a first year graduate student in the Earth and Planetary Science department where I study dune sediment sizes on Mars under the supervision of Dr. Devon Burr and Dr. Jeff Moersch. I did my undergraduate degree at Trent University in Peterborough, ON where I doubled majored in physics and physical geography (specializing in geomorphology). I moved to Knoxville 5 months ago from Toronto, ON. I am a stereotypical Canadian and have grown accustomed to the Canadian jokes. How do you get a Canadian to apologize? Step on their foot! I miss the snow but I am glad that I donât have to wake up early to shovel my driveway and to clear my car. I am also a big fan of corny jokes. How do you find Will Smith in the snow? Look for the fresh prints. I am excited to take this course and to learn more about statistics.
